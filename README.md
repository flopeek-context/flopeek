**Flopeek is local-first code intelligence for developers and coding agents.**
It parses supported repository structure into a deterministic local graph, then
turns that graph into small, evidence-backed views: where a technical flow
enters, which symbols and static relationships it touches, which tests are
directly related, what changed, and what context another person or agent can
reuse.

Large repositories make both people and coding agents repeatedly search,
reconstruct call paths, and carry oversized source excerpts between tasks.
Flopeek keeps one versioned graph on the machine and lets every supported
surface ask bounded questions of that same state.

The preserved product identity and its explicit pre-release boundary are in
[the product identity note](docs/product-identity.md).

> **Development status:** V1 uses Rust as the default TypeScript/TSX
> repository-truth authority with SQLite persistence. JavaScript remains an
> explicit compatibility/parity mode and is not a fallback for Rust authority.
> See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md).

## The five-minute change-context loop

Flopeek is most useful when a change forces you to reconstruct a technical
path before you edit it. The first experience is deliberately one loop, not a
feature tour:

1. **See one bounded static flow** in the local Flow Lens.
2. **Copy its versioned Context Ref** before the source changes.
3. **Apply one declared source change** in a disposable checkout.
4. **Compare before/current evidence** after the graph refreshes.
5. **Inspect related tests and the old Context Ref** instead of assuming either
   remains current.

The included checkout showcase runs that loop without executing its target
application. It is the fastest way to decide whether Flopeek is useful for a
repository you need to change.

## How it works

1. **Scan locally.** Supported parsers extract repository facts without running
   the target application.
2. **Build a versioned graph.** Nodes, relationships, parser coverage, and
   freshness are stored as reproducible local evidence.
3. **Focus the question.** Flow Lens, impact, comparison, and Context Packets
   return bounded views instead of the entire codebase.
4. **Reuse the evidence.** People and agents resolve the same Context Refs from
   the same graph version across Viewer, HTTP, CLI, and MCP.

![Repository to shared Flopeek context](docs/assets/shared-context-workflow.svg)

The design is deliberately evidence-aware: static parser facts, deterministic
inference, human verification, agent declarations, and opt-in runtime
observations remain separate. A static relationship is not a claim about
runtime order, business intent, or successful behavior.

### Focus one technical flow

Flow Lens reduces a repository graph to one bounded static path, with technical
steps, source locations, parser coverage, and a versioned Context Ref.

### Understand what changed

Before/current comparison identifies added, removed, and changed static
relationships between adjacent graph versions. It is change-orientation
evidence, not runtime history.

## Run the change-context loop

Install the explicitly named public beta from npm:

```powershell
npm install --global flopeek@beta
flopeek showcase
```

The showcase opens a safe temporary checkout flow. It does not execute the
target application or change the committed example.

Use the explicit `@beta` channel until a stable release is published. The
source checkout on public `main` remains canonical for contributors.

Public preview and stable versions are immutable Git tags on `main`, not long-
lived `alpha` or `beta` branches. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the
release contract.
Follow one live change:

1. Inspect the opening **Flow Lens** and copy its **Flow Context Card**.
2. Copy the **apply** command shown by the Viewer and run it in another
   terminal.
3. Open **Compare before/current** to inspect added static steps and changed
   relationships.
4. Inspect the directly related test candidate and resolve the earlier Context
   Ref; it should be explicitly marked stale.

[Open the five-minute walkthrough](docs/showcase-walkthrough.md). It records
the exact expected evidence, safe workspace boundary, reset path, and the
limits of this demonstration.

### Bring the same context to an agent

An agent starts with `get_agent_bootstrap`, resolves a flow or node, reads only the source it needs with its normal workspace tools, refreshes Flopeek after edits, and checks changed or stale context.

```text
get_agent_bootstrap
  → get_scan_status
  → get_entry_flows
  → get_flow_projection
  → get_related_tests
  → edit with existing workspace tools
  → refresh_graph
  → get_changed_contexts
```

Flopeek MCP exposes no arbitrary shell, deployment, credential, or repository-source write operation.

## Use it on a repository

Start with a TypeScript/Node repository if you want the closest fit to the
checkout showcase and the shortest local setup. Flopeek also has explicitly
bounded parser support beyond that starting point; check the
[support matrix](SUPPORT.md) before treating a missing relationship as absent.

After installing `flopeek@beta`:

```powershell
flopeek discover D:\path\to\repository --max-files 5000 --budget-ms 10000
flopeek scan D:\path\to\repository
flopeek scan D:\path\to\repository --max-files 5000 --max-bytes 250000000 --budget-ms 60000
flopeek scan D:\path\to\repository --package apps\api
flopeek scan D:\path\to\repository --no-cache
flopeek view D:\path\to\repository --level domain --format json
flopeek serve D:\path\to\repository --max-files 5000 --max-bytes 250000000 --budget-ms 60000
flopeek doctor D:\path\to\repository --platform all
```

The local Viewer and MCP expose the same scan freshness. If a bounded refresh
does not complete, Flopeek keeps the last complete graph and labels it
`stale-unverified` instead of serving a partial reconstruction.

### Focus one package first

For a large monorepo, select a concrete package directory before asking for a
technical map:

```powershell
flopeek discover D:\path\to\repository --package apps\api --format json
flopeek serve D:\path\to\repository --package apps\api
flopeek mcp D:\path\to\repository --package apps\api
```

The path must be inside the repository and contain its own regular
`package.json`. Flopeek labels the map as **Package: apps/api** for both people
and agents. It is a static source subtree, not proof of workspace membership,
dependency ownership, build activation, or runtime topology. To keep that
boundary safe, package scans are ephemeral sessions: they do not overwrite the
repository-wide cache and cannot join `serve --global` yet.

The selected subtree still obeys the repository's `.flopeek/config.json`
source, test, fixture, and exclusion rules; `--package` does not silently
override them.

Install project-local MCP configuration for a supported host:

```powershell
flopeek install D:\path\to\repository --platform codex
flopeek install D:\path\to\repository --platform claude
flopeek install D:\path\to\repository --platform cursor
flopeek install D:\path\to\repository --platform gemini
```

Flopeek preserves unrelated host settings and refuses conflicting managed entries. ChatGPT web cannot connect to a local stdio MCP server through this installer.

## Why use a graph instead of search alone?

Literal search is excellent when you already know the identifier. Flopeek becomes useful when you also need relationship order, reusable context identity, change impact, or a shared human/agent view.

![Orientation capability comparison](docs/assets/orientation-capabilities.svg)

The checked orientation suite contains three small source-pinned TypeScript/Python fixtures. Both conditions find all 10 targets and 3 tests. Only Flopeek produces the expected 14 ordered static steps and detects all 3 stale Context Refs. Oracle files are excluded from direct retrieval.

This benchmark does **not** prove developer productivity, AI patch quality, runtime order, or token savings. On these tiny fixtures, literal retrieval is faster and its returned text is smaller. Flopeek pays a cold graph-build cost to provide capabilities that literal retrieval does not model.

[Inspect the complete benchmark and raw evidence](BENCHMARKS.md)

## Reuse work on large repositories

Flopeek retains parser facts and reparses changed files. Relationship assembly remains graph-wide, but supported unchanged files do not need a full parser pass.

Before scanning an unfamiliar workspace, `flopeek discover` can report
candidate source, scope, static manifests, adapter demand, and declared resource
bounds without parsing source. A bounded CLI scan returns no partial graph and
does not replace the last complete cache. CLI, Viewer/HTTP/SSE, and MCP share
the same progress, cancellation, and `stale-unverified` outcome contract.

![Incremental scan evidence](docs/assets/incremental-performance.svg)

The chart reports one host-specific comparison for one supported unchanged file per pinned checkout. It is not a universal speed guarantee.

### Bounded proof snapshot

| Evidence | Checked result | Boundary |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Real-repository relationship audit | 92/92 | 14 declared scopes in 5 pinned repositories |
| Incremental parser reuse | 2.76×–8.75× | All 5 pinned repositories on one benchmark host; median of 3 samples per mode |
| Orientation graph retrieval | 14/14 ordered steps; 3/3 stale refs | 3 small fixtures; no human or provider study |
| Clean-room package | Strict allowlist; CLI, scan, and MCP bootstrap pass | One Windows/Node observation; the verifier itself does not publish |

Run the public proof contract:

```powershell
flopeek proof D:\path\to\repository --iterations 3
npm run test:real-corpus
npm run evaluate:orientation
```

## What Flopeek does not claim

- A static edge is not proof that code executed.
- A generated technical flow is not a verified business process.
- Missing evidence is not proof that behavior or tests are absent.
- Inventory-only files do not have inferred relationships.
- The audited 92/92 slice is not universal repository accuracy.
- A tagged release identifies a public preview or stable source snapshot; it
  does not turn static evidence into runtime proof.

Dynamic dispatch, dependency-injection containers, reflection, callbacks, macros, runtime module loading, and unsupported framework wiring may be absent from the static graph. Flopeek exposes parser coverage and limitations so a developer or agent knows when to inspect source directly.
